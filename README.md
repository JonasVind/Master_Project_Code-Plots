[![CC BY 4.0][cc-by-shield]][cc-by]

Relevant code, data, and figures generated thoughtout the master project. They are all sperated into the different folders for better overview. 

Included in the "Data" folder are the data collected to do the real price analysis. The data done on the different networks are not included as they are to large in size for github. Instead are a text file with links with where to find them.

Included in the "Figures" folders are all the generated figures from this projcet. This includes the mismatch, price and coherence analysis for all the networks. Also included are figures that was never used. The figures are named so they refere to the relavant network. These are not the same names as used in the thesis. For a conversion guide please see the text file named "guide to networks names" in the "other" folder.

Included in the "Software" folder are most of the python code developed in the project. The most important one being "functions_file" which includes all functions used in the other codes. This needs to be import correctly the same way the data needs for the software to run. Also included in the folder are the different codes for generating figures from the PCA done on the relevant networks. These codes are marked by called "omega" as they usually take ceveral minuts and includes every part of the analysis done on a network.

Included in the "Other" folder are short guide to the naming used in the project.
